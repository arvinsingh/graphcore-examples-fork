# Poplar Feature Examples

- [Advanced Features](advanced_example): This example performs a simple computation that demonstrates some of the advanced
features of Poplar (using dedicated programs for the I/O, using PopLibs, saving/reusing executables, choosing the number of IPUs...). It is a good follow-up to what is shown inside the Poplar tutorials.
- [Prefetching Callbacks](prefetch): This example shows how to implement the prefetching of the input stream of a Poplar program, using a callback, in order to maximise I/O performance.
